Another project that I have been working on for a long time is ready. My aim with this course is to plan the Onion Architecture via AspNet Core Api. In this project you will see many different design patterns in addition to Onion Architecture.
In my project where we used Onion as an architectural design pattern;

## CQRS

## Mediator

## Repository

I included the titles. We based our scenario on a "Car Rental" system. The title that gave our project and course its name came from our theme. The phrase "BookCar", which is our theme name, also became the name of our project.

You will need some requirements to develop this project. Unfortunately, it is not right to start this project without these, as you will have a hard time and will always leave things up in the air. Here, you must have developed an AspNet Core or even Api project if possible. If you have studied this subject, you have come to the right content to see new architecture and design patterns.

Also in our course

## Json Web Token

## SignalR

## Pivot Table

## Dto

## Fluent Validation

Topics are also included.
